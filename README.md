## Cleanning Data

For this project, I'm going to work as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. 

The goal is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
To do this, I'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store.

Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money.

To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, I should first try to see if I can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for my goals (both find in Kaggle):


* A **data set** containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. You can download the data set directly from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps).
* A **data set** containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the data set directly from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).
